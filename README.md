## Hi there 👋, I am Sreelakshmi Vellanki
I am someone who loves to build things and tell stories , and luckily, that’s becoming an actual career in the world of data.
Whether it’s a dashboard, a dataset, a small product concept, or a full analysis, I enjoy taking something raw and turning it into something people can understand, use, and make decisions with.

I don’t see data as rows and columns.
I see it as people, behaviors, patterns, and answers waiting to be uncovered.

--------------------------------------------------------
## What I Actually Do
I am not trying to list every tool I have ever used, just the things I genuinely enjoy working with:
- Power BI > building clean, intuitive dashboards
- SQL > answering real business questions
- Python > analysis, automation, and exploration
- Excel > fast analysis, formulas, and cleanup
- Storytelling > turning insights into decisions
- Thinking like a product person: Who is this for? What problem does it solve?
--------------------------------------------------------
## What I am Learning Right Now
- Building end-to-end data flows (SQL - Python - BI)
- Smarter, clearer reporting and dashboards
- Data engineering fundamentals and pipelines
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Writing better analysis narratives
--------------------------------------------------------
## Roles I am Exploring
Because these are roles where building + storytelling = impact:
- Data Analyst
- Power BI Developer
- Business Analyst
- Data Engineer (entry-level)
- Data Scientist (entry-level)
- Product Owner (data-focused teams)
---------------------------------------------------------
## How I Think About My Work
I ask “why?” a lot.

I like when things make sense — visually, logically, and strategically.

If I can build something useful and explain it clearly, that’s a good day.
